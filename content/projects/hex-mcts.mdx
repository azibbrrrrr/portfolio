## Introduction

- **Developed an AI agent** using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**, optimizing
  decision-making in the Hex board game.
- Collaborated with a **team of 4** to design and test the AI against bot
  agents, refining its strategies for improved performance.
- Implemented a **swap policy** to enhance gameplay efficiency when playing
  second.
- Achieved a **high win rate** against various bot opponents through adaptive
  decision-making.

## Features

### Swap Policy

- The agent intelligently decides whether to **swap colors** based on predefined
  board positions.
- Prioritizes central and elongated placements that could favor the opponent.
- If the opponent‚Äôs first move is in a critical position, the agent swaps to
  **gain a strategic advantage**.

### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for Decision-Making

- The agent uses **MCTS** to evaluate potential moves by running multiple
  simulations per turn.
- **Four key steps in MCTS:**
  1. **Selection:** Prioritizes moves balancing success probability and
     exploration.
  2. **Expansion:** Adds new game states to the search tree.
  3. **Simulation (Rollout):** Runs random or heuristic-based playouts to assess
     move quality.
  4. **Backpropagation:** Updates statistics based on simulation results to
     improve decision-making.
- By simulating **thousands of games**, the agent **strategically blocks
  opponents, builds strong connections, and optimizes board control**.

## Results

- Successfully **implemented an AI agent** capable of competing at a high level
  in Hex.
- Demonstrated **strong algorithmic optimization** with an adaptive strategy for
  different opponents.
- Achieved an **average win rate of ~89%** across five different bot opponents.

## Future Improvements

- Implement **deep learning techniques** to further refine decision-making.
- Enhance **adaptive learning** to dynamically adjust strategies against human
  players.
- Extend AI capabilities to support larger board sizes and variations of Hex.
