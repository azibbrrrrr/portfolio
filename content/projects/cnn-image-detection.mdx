## Evidence Detection Using Bi-LSTM and BERT 2024

**Coursework Project with Peer**  
University of Manchester, UK

This project involved training and evaluating Bi-LSTM and BERT models for
evidence detection in a large dataset consisting of over 23,000 training
examples and 4,000+ test instances. We compared the performance of both models,
achieving an accuracy of 87.92% with BERT, which outperformed Bi-LSTM by 6.5%.

### Key Features:

- **Model Training**: Trained Bi-LSTM and BERT models for evidence detection
  tasks.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Achieved 87.92% accuracy with BERT, showcasing the
  effectiveness of transformer-based models for NLP tasks.
- **Dataset**: Utilized a dataset with 23,000+ training examples and 4,000+ test
  instances for evaluation.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, BERT, Bi-LSTM, NLP

This project provided valuable insights into the application of state-of-the-art
NLP techniques and reinforced the importance of transformer-based models like
BERT for text classification and evidence detection tasks.
