## 📊 Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project leverages **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on
their behavior and demographics, providing actionable insights for personalized
marketing strategies.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Applied **unsupervised learning** techniques to analyze customer spending
  patterns.
- Used **K-Means clustering** to group customers into distinct segments.
- Derived insights to enhance **targeted marketing** and customer retention
  strategies.

## 📂 Dataset

The project utilizes the **Mall Customers Dataset**, which contains features
such as:

- **Age** – Customer’s age group.
- **Annual Income** – Income level in thousands.
- **Spending Score** – Customer's spending behavior rating.

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ **Optimal Cluster Selection** – Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the
best number of clusters.  
✅ **Customer Segmentation** – Identified distinct customer groups based on
income and spending patterns.  
✅ **Feature Scaling & Preprocessing** – Standardized data for better clustering
accuracy.  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Plotted clusters using **Matplotlib** for intuitive
insights.  
✅ **Big Data Processing** – Leveraged **PySpark** for handling large datasets
efficiently.

## 📊 Key Insights from Clustering

## Income vs. Spending Score per Cluster

/>
- **Cluster 0**: **Low-income** individuals with **varying** spending scores. -
**Cluster 1**: **High-income** individuals with **low** spending scores. -
**Cluster 2**: **Middle-to-high-income** individuals with **moderate** spending
scores. - **Cluster 3**: **High-income** individuals with **high** spending
scores. - **Cluster 4**: **Middle-income** individuals with **diverse** spending
patterns.

## Cluster Distribution by Gender

- **Cluster 0**: Largest customer group, with **males (59.26%)** outnumbering
females. - **Cluster 1-4**: More balanced gender distribution, but females
slightly outnumber males in most clusters.

## Customer Age Distribution by Cluster

/>
- **Cluster 0**: Majority are **young customers (18-30 years old)**. - **Cluster
1**: Small group, mostly **above 40**. - **Cluster 2**: Wide range, **20 to 60
years old**. - **Cluster 3**: Primarily **30s and early 40s**. - **Cluster 4**:
Mostly **older customers (50+ years old)**.
